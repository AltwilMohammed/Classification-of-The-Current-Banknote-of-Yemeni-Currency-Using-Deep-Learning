Classification of The Current Banknote of Yemeni Currency Using Deep Learning

Deep learning (DL) is a branch of machine learning (ML). DL technology is considered one of the hot topics within machine learning, artificial intelligence as well as data science, and analytics. Due to its learning capabilities from the given data. DL is widely applied in various applications like visual recognition, text analysis, cybersecurity, and more.
Nowadays, automated banking machines and the automatic sale of goods and banking services that can differentiate between Banknote currencies with different designs is a critical task.
This project aims to build a model that has the ability to differentiate between different banknotes using deep learning, and the focus will be on Yemeni banknotes, in particular, using a dataset collected from different sources. Three different pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural networks (CNN) are MobileNet, DenseNet121, and EfficientNetV2 They are trained on the same dataset with constant parameters for each.
The models achieved good promising results in both training and validation, Those Efficient models mentioned above reach a value of 97.55%,99.75%, and 99.70% respectively in terms of testing accuracy.
